    == CAD-60 Dataset ==

Each zipped directory contains following four types of files collected from one person. 

1) activityLabel.txt
- A file that maps each # to corresponding activity. (# is a ten-digit integer)
           
2) #.txt                 
- Skeleton data files.
- Skeleton data format details are in the next section of this README.

3) #/Depth_X.png                   
- Depth data file corresponding to frame number X of skeleton data (#.txt).
- (single channel 16-bit PNG)
           
4) #/RGB_X.png                    
- RGB data file corresponding to frame number X of skeleton data (#.txt).
- (three channel 8-bit PNG)



    == Skeleton Data Format ==

Skeleton data consists of 15 joints. There are 11 joints that have both 
joint orientation and joint position. And, 4 joints that only have joint
position. Each row follows the following format.

  Frame#,ORI(1),P(1),ORI(2),P(2),...,P(11),J(11),P(12),...,P(15)
    
    Frame# => integer starting from 1
    
    ORI(i) => orientation of ith joint
                0 1 2
                3 4 5
                6 7 8
              3x3 matrix is stored as followed by CONF
                0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,CONF
              Read NITE PDF (see below) to get more detail about the matrix
                
    P(i)   => position of ith joint followed by CONF
                x,y,z,CONF
              values are in milimeters
              
    CONF   => boolean confidence value (0 or 1)
              Read NITE PDF (see below) to get more detail about the confidence value
    
  Joint number -> Joint name
     1 -> HEAD
     2 -> NECK
     3 -> TORSO
     4 -> LEFT_SHOULDER
     5 -> LEFT_ELBOW
     6 -> RIGHT_SHOULDER
     7 -> RIGHT_ELBOW
     8 -> LEFT_HIP
     9 -> LEFT_KNEE
    10 -> RIGHT_HIP
    11 -> RIGHT_KNEE
    12 -> LEFT_HAND
    13 -> RIGHT_HAND
    14 -> LEFT_FOOT
    15 -> RIGHT_FOOT
    
Read page 10~13 of NITE 1.3 PDF for more detail on skeleton orientation, 
position, and confidence values.

    == Misc ==

Here are two useful equation that can be used to convert (x,y,z) coordinate into (x,y) pixel
number in 2D image approximately. Given the (x,y,z) location of the joint, you can find where
the joint is located within RGBD images.

x = 156.8584456124928 + 0.0976862095248 * x - 0.0006444357104 * y + 0.0015715946682 * z
y = 125.5357201011431 + 0.0002153447766 * x - 0.1184874093530 * y - 0.0022134485957 * z
